##  Coding Assignment Tic Tac Toe Challenge


# Functional Specification
Build a simple tic-tac-toe game.


# Guidelines
* You do not need to draw a pretty grid. 
* Three rows of comma-separated numbers will suffice.
* Please do not Google “Python tic-tac-toe”. We’ve already looked up the top results and know what that code looks like. Try to come up with the algorithm on your own.
* There's a 4-hour time limit on this. 
* You don't have to do it all in one day if you don't want.
* Save your work to a GitHub repository so we can review it.
*  Share the link with us, and include a README file that lists the features you implemented.
* Please return to us by Friday, Oct. 17, at noon CT.

## Tips
You’ll be making use of lists (arrays), and Python’s built-in functions like print() and input().
You can search for “Python read input” for help.
The Python documentation is your friend.

## How to use
* Two players take turns placing X’s and O’s on a 3x3 grid.
* The win condition is the first player to get three across a column, down a row, or on either diagonal.
